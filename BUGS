Current bugs:
-------------
When you hit the escape key, it takes about a second to register. Why?

The call to noecho doesn't seem to do anything. I tried a little
program that just does noecho and takes input, and that worked, so
something somewhere is undoing the effect of noecho.

ncurses doesn't cooperate with characters less than '!'. It displays
them as, eg ^A for what should by rights be a little smiley
face. draw.h uses the A_ALTCHARSET flag. It doesn't work.

Possible Improvements:
----------------------
The code generally needs to be cleaned up.

Although the code should compile on anything that has ncurses, the
special character set used probably won't be handled correctly on
anything but Linux/Intel. Have an option to stick to standard ASCII.

The program shouldn't depend on a hard-wired constant for the number
of messages.

I think the list of messages should be in a text file which is read in
at runtime, so that people can easily change the messages.

The screen array is bigger than it needs to be. It probably shouldn't
be an array at all, actually, since at most 1/8 of the entries are
full. It should be a hash or something.
