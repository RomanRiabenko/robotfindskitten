Possible Improvements:
----------------------
The code generally needs to be cleaned up.

Although the code should compile on anything that has ncurses, the
special character set used probably won't be handled correctly on
anything but Linux/Intel. Have an option to stick to standard ASCII.
[currently robotfindskitten is only standard ASCII.]

The screen array is bigger than it needs to be. It probably shouldn't
be an array at all, actually, since at most 1/8 of the entries are
full. It should be a hash or something.
