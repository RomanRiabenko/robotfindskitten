[v003.242 has highly-experimental color, sort of via compile-time switch.]

This may just be POSE hating me since I had an exciting time compiling
it on RH5.2:
*sometimes* I get a fatal error when I touch an object.  This
happened when running the color version with the (non-debug) color
ROM.  (Find out whether this occurs in the OS-2 (no color) compilation
(a) on Visor and (b) on POSE.  that may help track it down.)
