Makefile - it's a makefile
constants.h - numbers that one should think hard before changing
[messages.h - need to set the -I in Makefile to find it where it really lives]
rfk-palm.c - this is where all the action is
rfk-memo.{c,h} - get optional extra non-kitten-items from "rfk-fortune" memo 
rfk.bmp - picture for the about screen (this why I am not an art major)
robotfindskitten.bmp - the regular application icon
robotfindskitten.def - one line of text used by 'build-prc' not very exciting
robotfindskitten.pbm - the .bmp in .pbm format, because build-prc insists.
robotfindskitten.rcp[.in] - the UI resource file: defines each little screen
robotfindskittenRsc.h - #define's shared by the .rcp file and the .c file
robotfindskittenSmall.bmp - the tiny application icon
preprocess/Makefile - build an executable to figure out what MESSAGES is
preprocess/count_messages.c - (this is the easiest way to do it)
preprocess/tweak_rcp.pl - generate the .rcp from the .rcp.in, w/ MESSAGES.

this stuff should build:

robotfindskitten.prc - The executable!  Install this on your handheld device.


The part of the version number that is "number of nki" appears in four
places in robotfindskitten.rcp.  The stuff in preprocess has the task
of figuring out what that number is really supposed to be (by
consulting messages.h) and inserting that number in those locations in
robotfindskitten.rcp.  It's frivolous.
